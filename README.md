NFT marketplace Application using Next.js 

Tech stack: Next JS, Ethereum Blockchain, Metamask, Thirdweb hooks

Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are an emerging technology that has already seen a ton of use cases outside the typical NFT application â€“ which right now is mostly for trading artworks and game characters.
NFTs are also used for digital land purchases in virtual worlds and for next-generation music ownership, licensing and publishing. Some observers see a future in which NFTs offer access to special sales or limited-edition products. 

The possibilities of NFTs are endless, since they can be used to log ownership of any unique assets.

In this Project we will develop a Full-Stack application using Next.js for NFT trading and secure transactions via blockchain.
