## 1.Title:

# NFT marketplace Application using Next.js

# Introduction to the problem statement:

● NFT will continue to gain prominence in 2022 and is growing as a new asset class in the crypto
space. There should be an efficient exchange medium for NFTs.

● NFT marketplaces are focused on selling specific assets. For example, the Valuables NFT
marketplace allows users to buy and sell tweets.

● The possibilities of NFTs are endless, since they can be used to log ownership of any unique
assets.

● In this Project we will develop a Full-Stack application using Next.js for NFT trading and secure
transactions via blockchain.

# Abstract:

Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are an emerging technology that has already seen a ton of use cases
outside the typical NFT application – which right now is mostly for trading artworks and game characters.
At its core, an NFT is a tool that creates non-fungible digital assets using blockchain. There are two
major benefits that can be gained from these features. Primarily, NFT offers the certification of
ownership. With blockchain-based NFT, the record of ownership is protected from changes or
modification. This makes a digital asset to only have one official owner at a time. Subsequently,
consumers do not have to worry about the risk of counterfeiting.

# Approach:

The Web application is developed using Next.js and for the Authentication we use Metamask and Third
webhooks.
